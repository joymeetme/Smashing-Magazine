# SMASHING-MAGAZINE
Playing with Visual Hierarchy In this Simple Odin Project,you‚Äôll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine, Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise was to start training to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles. creating a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy,and to ensure all the elements on the page  are grouped together. This was also an opportunity to get better at positioning div elements.
